### About Me

I am a genomics scientist with a great enthusiasm for the applications of Computational Biology (CB) and Machine Learning. I have 5 years of total experience, with 4 years working as a postdoctoral assistant professor and one year as a genomics scientist.  
I've been intrigued by CB since early days of my PhD career, when I integrated dry lab and wet lab approaches to perform a genome-wide scan for regulatory genomic variants affecting noncoding RNA network in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. After completing the degree, I eagerly moved toward CB by pursuing an autodidactic hands-on career and realized that having experience in both experimental and computational biology provides a great perspective and capacity to effectively collaborate with scientists from broad disciplines.

Throughout my career, I have been actively pursuing self-training in statistics (basic, meta-analysis, and machine learning), bioinformatics, coding and data visualization in R/Bioconductor and Python, and version control system and gained invaluable experience in retrieving, analyzing, and integrating omics data into bioinformatics workflows.

### Projects and Publications

#### Bioinformatics approaches in complex disorders
We designed bioinformatics workflows to carry out genome-wide scans for disease-associated variants that influence noncoding RNA network in complex disorders. Specifically, we were interested in the identification, functional annotation and prioritization of genetic variations in microRNA targetome of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. We integrated data from various sources (e.g.GWAS , other association studies, expression studies, 1000 genomes project, dbSNP) and perform several bioinformatics analysis to characterize polymorphisms disrupting miRNA target sites and provided deep insights into the way each polymorphism may affect miRNA:mRNA interaction. We analyzed the effect of polymorphisms on structural ensemble of 3'-UTRs, local RNA structure, RNA accessibility, and hybrid stability.The findings helped to characterize and prioritize disease-associated variants in microRNA network of complex disorders.
