### About me

I am a genomics scientist with a great enthusiasm for the applications of Computational Biology (CB) and Machine Learning. I have 5 years of total experience, with 4 years working as a postdoctoral assistant professor and one year as a genomics scientist. I've been intrigued by CB since early days of my PhD career, when I integrated dry lab and wet lab approaches to perform a genome-wide scan for regulatory genomic variants affecting noncoding RNA network in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. After completing the degree, I eagerly moved toward CB by pursuing an autodidactic hands-on career and realized that having experience in both experimental and computational biology provides a great perspective and capacity to effectively collaborate with scientists from broad disciplines.

Throughout my career, I have been actively pursuing self-training in statistics (basic, meta-analysis, and machine learning), bioinformatics, coding and data visualization in R/Bioconductor and Python, and version control system and gained invaluable experience in retrieving, analyzing, and integrating omics data into bioinformatics workflows.
### Jekyll Themes
